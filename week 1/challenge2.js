    The Variable should not be used like this.
    By writting the variable there is no space between the variable words.
    And the last is There is no use of const.
    We use here is, let ;

// Correct way of writting this code;
let someNumber = 20;

/*  
    We use const there only, when we don't change the value after giving the value to variable.
    Let, we use when we want to change the values of variable later.
